\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chapter:introduction}

In this chapter we introduce Distributed Deep Learning and the problems surrounding it. A more detailed description of the subject of study is given in Chapter~\ref{chapter:distributed_deep_learning}. Furthermore, we make the reader more comfortable with the notation and abbreviations used throughout this thesis. Finally, we formally define the problem statement in Section~\ref{sec:problem_statement}, and give an outline of this thesis in Section~\ref{sec:thesis_outline}.

\section[Distributed Deep Learning]{Distributed Deep Learning, an introduction}
\label{sec:intro_distributed_deep_learning}

Unsupervised feature learning and deep learning has shown that being able to train large models can drastically improve model performance. However, consider the problem of training a deep network with millions, or even billions of parameters. How do we achieve this without waiting for days, or even multiple weeks? Dean et al.~propose a different training paradigm which allows us to train and serve a model on multiple physical machines~\cite{dean2012large}. The authors propose two novel methodologies to accomplish this. Namely, \emph{model parallelism}, introduced in Section~\ref{sec:intro_model_parallelism}, and \emph{data parallelism}, introduced in Section~\ref{sec:intro_data_parallelism}.\\

In this thesis we study \emph{data parallelism}, since this methodology mainly focuses on the development of distributed optimization algorithms. Whereas, \emph{model parallelism} is mainly an engineering effort, because it still follows the traditional optimization scheme, i.e., sequential gradient updates in the case the applied optimizer utilizes a gradient based approach.

\subsection{Model Parallelism}
\label{sec:intro_model_parallelism}

In \emph{model parallelism}, a single model is distributed over multiple machines~\cite{dean2012large}. The performance benefits of distributing a deep network across multiple machines mainly depends on the structure of the model. Models with a large number of parameters typically benefit from access to more CPUs and memory, up to the point where communication costs, i.e., propagation of weight updates and synchronization mechanisms, dominate~\cite{dean2012large}.\\

Let us start with a simple example in order to illustrate this concept more clearly. Imagine having a perceptron, as depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:introduction_model_parallelism_perceptron}. In order to parallelize this efficiently, we can view a neural network as a dependency graph, where the goal is to minimize the number of synchronization mechanisms, assuming we have unlimited resources. Furthermore, a synchronization mechanism is only required when a node has more than 1 \emph{variable} dependencies. A variable dependency is a dependency which can change in time. For example, a bias would be a \emph{static} dependency, because the value of a bias remains constant over time. In the case for the perceptron shown in Figure~\ref{fig:introduction_model_parallelism_perceptron}, the parallelization is quite straightforward. The only synchronization mechanism which should be implemented resides in output neuron because $y \triangleq \sum_i w_ix_i$.

  \caption{A perceptron partitioned using the \emph{model parallelism} paradigm. In this approach every input node is responsible for accepting the input $x_i$ from some source, and multiplying the input with the associated weight $w_i$. After the multiplication, the result is sent to the node which is responsible for computing $y$. Of course, this node requires a synchronization mechanism to ensure that the result is consistent. The synchronization mechanism does this by waiting for the results $y$ depends on.}

\subsection{Data Parallelism}
\label{sec:intro_data_parallelism}

In this thesis, we focus our efforts on data parallelism. Data parallelism is an inherently different methodology of optimizing parameters. Whereas, in model parallelism, the procedure of the optimization algorithm is still identical.
